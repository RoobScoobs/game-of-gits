House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

After moving to King's Landing, Ned Stark exposed the Lannisters' incestuous
relationship. Twin brother and sister, Jaimie and Cersei, were forced to walk
through the Red Keep naked while everyone shouted "shame!" Ned had saved the
life of his King, and Joffrey was exiled to a remote island just for children
born from incest.
